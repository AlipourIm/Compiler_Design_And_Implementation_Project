01) #type_id : push type of function or variable(next input) into semantic_stack.
02) #decl_id : push id of function, array or variable into semantic stack.
03) #end_decl_var : uses #1 and #2 and completes declaration by calling symbol table.
04) #push_num : pushes immediate NUMber into stack.
05) #end_decl_arr : uses #1 and #2 and #4 and completes declaration of array by calling symbol table.
06) #inc_scope : increments scope counter when '{' is seen.
07) #dec_scope : decrements scope counter when '}' is seen.
08) #push_id : pushes address assigned to ID into stack.
09) #push_op : push the operator symbol like +,-,==,<,* into semantic stack.
10) #operate : perform the binary operation which its operands and operator has been pushed already.
11) #indirect_addr : allocate a temp variable and save indirect addr for ID[EXP], pop(2) and push(temp).
12) #assign : assign top of stack into top-1 of stack and pop(1).
13) #pop_exp : pop the expression result from stack if semicolon is seen.
14) #label : push into ss the label for next upcoming code in program block (push(i)).
15) #repeat_jump : add code to jump to first of loop if until condition has been satisfied.
16) #save_label : save a code empty for back-patching, push label into ss
17) #if_jpf : in case of 'if' 'else', fill the JPF for if, that was saved.
18) #if_jpf_save_label : in case of 'if' with 'else', fill the JPF for 'if' condition, save a code empty for end of then to be jumped after else
19) #then_jp : fill the unconditional jump saved in #18, jump at the end of then to after of else.
20) #inc_loop_cnt : increments loop counter
21) #save_break : save a code for break to be back-patched in #15
22) #end_arr_param : uses #1 and #2 and completes definition of array param by calling symbol table and setting its offset.
23) #end_var_param : uses #1 and #2 and completes definition of variable param by calling symbol table and setting its offset.
24) #start_var_param : insert function lexeme to symbol table
25) #call_func : calls function
26) #return_void : return void procedure in callee
27) #return_exp : return expression procedure in callee
28) #jp_main : perform back patching to jump to main
29) #assign_to_local : allocate a local, assign condition(whether indirect like 'x[0]' or direct 'a') to local offset
